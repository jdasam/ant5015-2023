    This dataset class returns melody information as a tensor with shape of [num_notes, 2 (pitch, duration)].
    
    To train a melody language model, you have to provide a sequence of original note, and a sequence of next note for given original note.
    In other word, melody[i+1] has to be the shifted_melody[i], so that melody[i]'s next note can be retrieved by shifted_melody[i]
    (Remember, language model is trained to predict the next upcoming word)
    
    Also, to make genration easier, we usually add 'start' token at the beginning of sequence, and 'end' token at the end of the sequence.
    With these tokens, we can make the model recognize where is the start and end of the sequence explicitly.
    
    You have to add these tokens to the note sequence at this step.

                                 The first element of the sequence has to be the index for 'start' token for both pitch and duration.
                                 The melody should not include 'end' token
